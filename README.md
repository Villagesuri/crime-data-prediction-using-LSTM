# crime-data-prediction-using-LSTM
  This project focuses on time series forecasting of crime data, specifically predicting reported rape cases using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. Data is loaded from a CSV file with dates properly parsed and visualized for trend analysis. Pre-processing involves selecting the 'Rape' column, reshaping it, and normalizing values with MinMaxScaler to scale them between 0 and 1. A dataset is created by forming input-output pairs, where a 30-day window predicts the next day's value. Data is split into training and testing sets without shuffling to maintain temporal order.An LSTM model is built using a sequential architecture with one LSTM layer (50 units) and a Dense output layer. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss function. It is trained over 10 epochs with a batch size of 32, validating on the test set. Predictions are generated, inverse-transformed back to the original scale, and compared to actual values through visualization. A line graph shows the differences between predicted and real cases over time, and the modelâ€™s performance is assessed using the MSE metric.This project demonstrates how deep learning can be leveraged for crime forecasting, providing insights that could aid law enforcement agencies in resource allocation and crime prevention strategies.
